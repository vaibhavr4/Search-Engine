Stop words are the words that are most common and dont have any contribution in finding the document.
Removing common words from stream of tokens or index terms is known as Stopping.
Stop words vary based on the language, in English stop words are nothing but functional words
that help form a sentence.
Such words can be removed from the vocabulary in order to 
save disk space and also to get rid of the overhead to traverse through those 
words during search process.
The Stop words list are generated as below:

	1. Generate a term frequency table from a given corpus, where the 
           occurence for each term is mentioned.
	2. Sort the term frequency in a descending order such that terms 
           with maximum number of occurence appear at the top.
	3. Scan through the terms from top and based on the relevance of the 
           terms in respect to the topical content, choose a threshold value.
	4. Make a stoplist of terms till that threshold.
	5. Filter the stoplist to remove the terms which are related to the 
	   topical content.

The cut off value for the stop list is set as 47 which includes the top 47 most frequent words
in the documents crawled. 4 of the words from the above stop list can be filtered out since
they are directly associated with the contents. The 4 words are;

hurricane:7769 (Total term frequency)
tropical:5220 (Total term frequency)
storm:4095 (Total term frequency)
retrieved:3607 (Total term frequency)

JUSTIFICATION AND COMMENTS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stop list is set to a size or cut off value of 47 since the words occuring after this cut off value
have more relevance to the documents or topical content. Though increasing the cut off value might
reduce the overhead time,doing so may eliminate the words which can be used as keywords for searching 
a particular document. For instance, setting a cut off value to 60 will include many words that have more
relevance to the document. 
If we have to filter by hand only 4 words get added to stop list, which are 
'3','4','5','b', while the remaining words have to be filtered out. Since ging further down the term 
frequency list may increase the probability of words that are more relevant to the document, the cut off 
value has been set to 47 with 4 words mentioned above filtered, which makes the stop list to consist of
43 words.
The 43 words are just functional words such as 'the','of','and','a','in' which just help complete a
sentence and are common in all or most of the documents and hold no key importance while searching for a
document by keyword.
