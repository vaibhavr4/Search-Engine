known as storm ophelia in ireland and the united kingdom while extratropical was the easternmost atlantic major hurricane on record the tenth consecutive hurricane and the sixth major hurricane of the very active 2017 atlantic hurricane season ophelia had non-tropical origins from a decaying cold front on 6 october located within a favorable environment the storm steadily strengthened over the next two days drifting north and then southeastwards before becoming a hurricane on 11 october after becoming a category 2 hurricane and fluctuating in intensity for a day ophelia intensified into a major hurricane on 14 october south of the azores brushing the archipelago with high winds and heavy rainfall shortly after achieving peak intensity ophelia began weakening as it accelerated over progressively colder waters to its northeast towards ireland and great britain completing an extratropical transition early on 16 october ophelia became the second storm of the 201718 uk and ireland windstorm season early on 17 october the cyclone crossed the north sea and struck western norway with wind gusts up to 70 kilometres per hour 43 mph in rogaland county before weakening during the evening the system made additional landfalls in sweden and finland before dissipating over russia three deaths can be direcly attributed to ophelia all of which occurred in ireland the total losses from the storm are estimated at 1 billion us 1.18 billion mostly from economic losses insured damage claims as of 24 october reached 6 million us 7 million in ireland and 510 million us 6.613.2 million in the united kingdom meteorological history map plotting the track and intensity of the storm according to the saffirsimpson scale on 6 october the united states national hurricane center nhc began monitoring the tail end of a decaying cold front for possible subtropical or tropical cyclogenesis 1 on the same day a circulation developed on the periphery of this front 1 soon afterwards a non-tropical low developed within the circulation and drifted to the southwest before becoming nearly stationary 2 the system began to acquire subtropical characteristics on the next day and the chances of development were raised to a high percentage of cyclogenesis 3 after a brief loss of organization and diminished convection due to moderate wind shear 4 the system continued to steadily organize and developed a well-defined circulation center early on 9 october as deep convection began to persist near the center 5 by 09:00 utc that day the convection had persisted long enough for the system to be classified as a tropical depression about 875 mi 1,410 km west-southwest of the azores and the storm was identified as tropical depression seventeen 6                 nb 1 relation to climate change climate scientist reindert haarsma of the royal netherlands meteorological institute said that climate change is likely to cause europe to see more hurricanes like ophelia as the oceans get warmer although they were still comparing their model s results previously reported in 2013 with those from other climate centres 55 but ucd professor ray bates and ray mcgrath also of ucd argued that insofar as the influence of the sea surface temperature is concerned the exceptional strength of storm ophelia was due to natural variability rather than global warming 56 see also tropical

however as these years are several decades before the advent of satellite data post-1966 these years may be considered unreliable as several tropical storms in between could have been easily missed
