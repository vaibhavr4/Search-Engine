mediterranean tropical-like cyclone wikipedia mediterranean tropical-like cyclones sometimes referred to as mediterranean hurricanes or medicanes are rare meteorological phenomena observed in the mediterranean sea due to the dry nature of the mediterranean region formation of tropical cyclones is infrequent with only 99 recorded tropical-like storms between 1948 and 2011 no agency however is officially responsible for monitoring the formation and development of medicanes tropical cyclogenesis typically occurs within two separate regions of the sea the first region encompassing areas of the western mediterranean is more conducive for development than the other the ionian sea to the east the rough mountainous geography of the region raises additional difficulties despite being favorable for the development of severe weather and convective activity in general and only with abnormal meteorological circumstances can medicanes form numerous studies have been conducted on the impact of global warming on mediterranean tropical cyclone formation generally concluding that fewer yet more intense storms would form the development of tropical cyclones in the mediterranean sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions of cold air are often required a majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convectionthunderstormsand heavy precipitation the baroclinic properties of the mediterranean region with high temperature gradients also provides necessary instability for the formation of tropical cyclones another factor rising cool air provides necessary moisture as well warm sea surface temperatures ssts are mostly unnecessary however as most medicanes energy is derived from warmer air temperatures when these favorable circumstances coincide the genesis of warm-core mediterranean tropical cyclones often from within existing cut-off cold-core lows is possible in a conducive environment for formation several notable and damaging medicanes are known to have occurred in september 1969 a north african mediterranean tropical cyclone produced flooding that killed nearly 600 individuals left 250,000 homeless and crippled local economies a medicane in september 1996 that developed in the balearic islands region spawned six tornadoes and inundated parts of the islands several medicanes have also been subject to extensive study such as those of january 1982 january 1995 september 2006 november 2011 and november 2014 the january 1995 storm is one of the best-studied mediterranean tropical cyclones with its close resemblance to tropical cyclones elsewhere and availability of observations the medicane of september 2006 meanwhile is well-studied due to availability of existing observations and data in november 2011 the noaa s satellite analysis branch monitored a medicane named rolf by the free university of berlin fu berlin though it ceased doing so the following month in 2015 the noaa resumed issuing advisories for tropical systems in the mediterranean region climatology visible satellite imagery of a medicane above the balearic islands on 7 october 1996 mediterranean tropical cyclones are not considered to be formally classified tropical cyclones and their region of formation is not officially monitored by any agency 1 and though the satellite analysis branch released information related to a medicane in november 2011 while it was active it ceased doing so on 16 december 2011.    63 despite the fact that no agency is officially responsible for monitoring tropical cyclone activity in the mediterranean 1 on 4 november 2011 a frontal system associated with another low-pressure area monitored by fu berlin designated quinn spawned a second low-pressure system inland near marseille which was subsequently named rolf by the university an upper-level trough on the european mainland stalled as it approached the pyrenees before approaching and interacting with the low known as rolf heavy rainfall consequently fell over regions of southern france and northwestern italy resulting in widespread landslides and flooding on 5 november rolf slowed while stationed above the massif central maintaining a pressure of 1000 mbar 29.53 inhg a stationary front stationed between madrid and lisbon approached rolf the same day with the cold front later encountering and become associated with rolf which would continue for several days 63 on 6 november the cyclone drifted toward the mediterranean from the southern shoreline of france shrinking to a diameter of merely 150 km 93 mi across slightly weakening rolf neared the balearic islands on 7 november associated with two fronts producing heavy rain throughout europe before separating entirely and transitioning into a cut-off low 63 the same day the noaa began monitoring the system designating it as 01m marking the first time it officially monitored a medicane a distinct eye-like feature developed while spiral banding and intense convection became evident at its highest the dvorak technique classified the system as t3.0 convection gradually decreased and a misalignment of the mid and upper level centers was noted the system continued to rapidly weaken on 9 november before advisories were halted on the system later that day 2 and fu berlin followed suit by 10 november removing the name rolf from its weather maps and declaring its dissipation 63 the deep warm core of this cyclone persisted for a longer time compared to other tropical-like cyclones in the mediterranean 30 november 2014 qendresa cyclone qendresa on 7 november main article cyclone qendresa on 6 november 2014 the low-level circulation centre of qendresa formed near kerkennah islands 64 as the system was moving north-northeastwards and combining with an upper-level low from tunisia early on 7 november the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically with an eye-like feature thanks to favourable conditions qendresa directly hit malta when it had lost its fronts with a more well-defined eye with ten-minute sustained winds at 110.9 km h 68.9 mph and the gust at 153.7 km h 95.5 mph 65 the central pressure was presumed to be 978 hpa 28.88 inhg interacting with sicily the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an anticlockwise loop on 8 november qendresa crossed syracuse in the morning and then significantly weakened 64 turning southeastwards then moving eastwards 66 qendressa moved over crete before dissipating over the island on november 11. 67 october 2016 90m 90m on 30 october 2016 on early 28 october 2016 35 mph 60 km h winds began to form into an extratropical cyclone south of calabria in the ionian sea it quickly intensified attaining wind speeds of 50 mph 80 km h as it slowly moved to the west causing high waves and minor damage to cars near the maltese city of valletta 68 weakening the following day and beginning to move eastwards however later that day it began to re-intensify becoming a tropical storm on 31 october after passing over crete it then began to quickly weaken with the storm degenerating into an extratropical low on 1 november 69 tropical storm 90m was also nicknamed medicane trixi by some media outlets in europe during its duration 70 other storms numerous other mediterranean cyclones have occurred but few have been as well-documented as those in 1969 1982 1995 1996 2006 2011 and 2014 on 27 september 1983 a medicane was observed at sea between tunisia and sicily looping around sardinia and corsica coming ashore twice on the islands before making landfall at tunis early on 2 october and dissipating the development of the system was not encouraged by baroclinic instability rather convection was incited by abnormally high sea surface temperatures ssts at the time of its formation it also featured a definitive eye tall cumulonimbus clouds intense sustained winds and a warm core for most of its duration it maintained a diameter of 200 to 300 km 120 to 190 mi though it shrank just before landfall on ajaccio to a diameter of 100 km 62 mi four other notable cyclones occurred in the late twentieth century on 26 march 1983 2930 december 1984 3031 october 1997 and 58 december 1997 all exhibiting characteristics closely resembling tropical cyclones elsewhere 32 a study performed in 2013 revealed several additional storms and additional information on medicanes forming on 7 april 1984 14 december 1985 5 december 1991 15 january 1995 10 december 1996 26 january 1998 19 march 1999 and 27 may 2003. 71 a second study conducted in 2007 revealed additional storms forming on 18 october 2003 27 october 2005 and 15 december 2005. 72 a third study revealed several other cyclones of which developed on 13 september 1999 10 september 2000 9 october 2000 19 september 2004 3 november 2004 17 and 26 october 2007
